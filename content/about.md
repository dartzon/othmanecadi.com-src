Hi there, and welcome to my blog.
My name is Othmane AIT EL CADI and I am software developer, a Linux enthusiast and a bit of a gamer
when my son is sleeping or not crying for attention.

I mainly write C++ code for a living and enjoy using it for my personal projects too. For this
reason I've created this blog to share technical thoughts with the world and also to server as a
personal reminder as I tend to forget a lot of the stuff I read or learn from others... Also this
is a good place where I can develop my English writing skills (Please bear with me if my grammar
makes your eyes bleed).
